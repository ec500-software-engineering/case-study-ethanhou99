# Case study - React Native

## Technology and Platform
The React Native is a framework found by Facebook, it let you build mobile application using JavaScript.
### a.
The coding language I'm using is JavaScript with React. If the project is started today, I will still use React Native, since React Native can let you build a mobile application without considering the operation system like iOS or Android. Compared to Swift, Kotlin and Java, React is the best choice if the App is simple and no security requirement. However, if you want to build a professional App and the application security is important, then the professional programming languages are better choices because React Native is JavaScript based library which is famous for its fragility. In a word, for the in class peoject, the React Native is enough.
### b.
To build a React Native App, you'll need:
* Node.js package manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/))
* [Node 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Expo CLI
```
Installing by:
npm install -g expo-cli
```
